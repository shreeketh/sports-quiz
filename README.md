# SportsQuiz by Shreeketh
Here, I have hardcoded few sports related questions. In the UI I'll let user to select answer, on submission correct answer will be shown with right mark and wrong answer will be marked with X mark.

Only once user can submit their answers and after submission a graph will be shown using Chart.js.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.6.
